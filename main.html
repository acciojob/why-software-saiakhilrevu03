	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that can help people in their daily lives. Coding allows me to combine creativity with logical thinking, turning ideas into real projects that add value. The field of development is always evolving, which means I will continuously learn new technologies and improve my skills, keeping my work exciting and challenging. I also appreciate how development opens opportunities to collaborate with people around the world and to contribute to projects that can make a positive impact. Becoming a developer aligns with my desire for continuous growth, creativity, and making a meaningful difference through technology.</p>
